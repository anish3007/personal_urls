## Intro to Computer Science
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382eX9-tF75Wa4lmlC7sxNDH : Harvard’s CS50 class: best high-quality online course for getting started to learning Computer Science. It explains the most fundamental topics in Computer Science: Computational Thinking, Arrays, Memory, Data Structures, Web Programming, and Databases. Recommended to check this out if you are used to learning content by videos.

## Any programming language, library, or tool you need
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm : TutorialsPoint: aka the reference book/dictionary for anything that you can think of. It’s the best online reference resource that gives you quick access to the most useful information about the topic. For example, when you are learning the basics of Python or just switching to this new language from another, this resource lists out the variable declarations, common data structures, built-in functions prototypes, etc. used in Python. Each topic is structured in a very organized and logical way that is easy to follow and understand. It is a must-have pocketbook for each developer to own.

## Web Development
https://www.freecodecamp.org/ : FreeCodeCamp: this is hands-down the best learning resource for getting started to web development. It teaches you everything about web starting from the beginning — from front-end HTML, CSS to Javascript to back-end NodeJS to databases to more advanced topics. It is the most comprehensive, open-source resource out there with a huge community of support. So if you want to learn any particular language/library about web development, just jump to the section that you want to learn and you will get tons of guiding tutorials and examples for you to follow.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ : MDN Web Docs: this is the official documentation website for modern web standards that you can refer to when building your own website of any kind. It gives you comprehensive tutorials to HTML, CSS, Javascript, Graphics, HTTP, APIs, etc. I recommend you to check out their Javascript introductory article to get brushed up to its syntax quickly if you are switching over to Javascript from another language or just reviewing how Javascript works fundamentally.
