## Intro to Computer Science
  + https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382eX9-tF75Wa4lmlC7sxNDH : Harvard’s CS50 class: best high-quality online course for getting started to learning Computer Science. It explains the most fundamental topics in Computer Science: Computational Thinking, Arrays, Memory, Data Structures, Web Programming, and Databases. Recommended to check this out if you are used to learning content by videos.

## Any programming language, library, or tool you need
  + https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm : TutorialsPoint: aka the reference book/dictionary for anything that you can think of. It’s the best online reference resource that gives you quick access to the most useful information about the topic. For example, when you are learning the basics of Python or just switching to this new language from another, this resource lists out the variable declarations, common data structures, built-in functions prototypes, etc. used in Python. Each topic is structured in a very organized and logical way that is easy to follow and understand. It is a must-have pocketbook for each developer to own.

## Web Development
  + https://www.freecodecamp.org/ : FreeCodeCamp: this is hands-down the best learning resource for getting started to web development. It teaches you everything about web starting from the beginning — from front-end HTML, CSS to Javascript to back-end NodeJS to databases to more advanced topics. It is the most comprehensive, open-source resource out there with a huge community of support. So if you want to learn any particular language/library about web development, just jump to the section that you want to learn and you will get tons of guiding tutorials and examples for you to follow.

  + https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ : MDN Web Docs: this is the official documentation website for modern web standards that you can refer to when building your own website of any kind. It gives you comprehensive tutorials to HTML, CSS, Javascript, Graphics, HTTP, APIs, etc. I recommend you to check out their Javascript introductory article to get brushed up to its syntax quickly if you are switching over to Javascript from another language or just reviewing how Javascript works fundamentally.

  + https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/ : W3Schools: Similar to TutorialsPoint, W3Schools explains web concepts in a very organized and structural way, making it extremely easy for beginners to understand and follow. I suggest beginners who are just getting started into front-end development to check out this resource and follow its tutorials. It offers online code compiler next to each of its examples, so make sure to take advantage of it when trying out your code!
  

## Mobile App Development
  + https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ/videos : Kalle Hallden Youtube: This channel teaches you how to build mobile apps quickly using Flutter, a new development framework for developing cross-platform apps by Google. If you want to learn how Flutter works from practical coding projects, this is the right video channel for you! Kalle often shows you how to make popular app clones like Instagram and Netflix to keep you motivated and also shows a lot of his own projects too.
  

## General Machine Learning and AI Applications
  + https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A : Siraj Raval Youtube: most educational and entertaining youtube channel for learning anything about AI. Siraj Raval’s interesting humor and educational videos teach you machine learning and AI in a fun way. He makes videos about practical AI projects and walks you through the entire process of implementing them with the Github code linked in his videos. He also teaches about mathematical theories behind the particular AI he is implementing so you can get a big overview of the technical motivation behind the technologies. Recently he is also working on his “build a startup” series which I am a big fan of, where he guides you in creating an AI app with commercial capabilities. If you are interested in machine learning, you must check out his channel!

  + https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz : Two Minute Papers Youtube: the name speaks for itself — it digests technical pieces of knowledge in research papers into a few minutes of simple explanations and clear visuals, making it easy for people to understand. Although I wouldn’t skip reading research papers for this, this youtube channel gives a good insight into the interesting topics the current machine learning academia is focusing on


## Deep Learning (Computer Vision & NLP)
  + http://cs231n.stanford.edu/ : Stanford’s CS 231N: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course is one of the hottest popular online courses for deep learning now. It teaches about the fundamentals of deep learning and its applications to computer vision. The syllabus covers from the basic image classification, loss functions, convolutional neural networks, and training to more advanced topics like recurrent neural networks, generative models, and deep reinforcement learning. Its lecture videos and assignments are released publicly and solutions to their assignments can be found in a lot of Github repositories. Watch the video lectures here(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
  + http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/ : Stanford’s CS 224N: Similar to CS231N, this is a deep learning course by Stanford, focusing on Natural Language Processing. It has all the benefits that CS 231N has. It covers concepts from word embeddings, neural networks, backpropagation, dependency parsing, language models, RNNs, sequence-to-sequence models with attention, question-answering, and many more advanced topics beyond. Go to the youtube playlist(http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z) to find the lecture videos.
  + https://www.fast.ai/ : Fast.ai: Fast.ai teaches deep learning using their fast.ai library, which adopts the modern best practices from state-of-the-art research papers. Their library allows for easy implementation for neural networks and fast training for maximizing their accuracies. Their video courses take you step-by-step into implementing top-performing neural networks. The best thing about Fast.ai is, it does not assume that you have prior knowledge of deep learning or university math level experience; so if you are a beginner to the world of AI, there is no need to worry. It focuses on building practical AI instead of mathematical theories going behind on the scenes, so this is extremely useful for you if you are seeking to build your next big AI project.
